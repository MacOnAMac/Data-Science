The data is binary classification with Target 1 as a fault of a mechnical part if a system.

Theres data about:
Component Age, 
Time since last checkup
Flow rate of fluid through the part
Volume of flow
Max output
Location (A or B) 
and sensor data from 6 sensors 


Here a mix of linear models have been applied to see how grid search affects a Logisitc regression and random forest model with a data set where the Target rate is very imbalenced. 

More data or further hyperparmaeter tweaking (plus data manipulation) is the next avenue for exploration
