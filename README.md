Some tests for Data modelling skills and exploring data handling



################### Titanic model ##################
The titanic model takes in survival data from the Titanc ship crash,


Initial EDA is done, and a pipeline is used to impute the missing data within limits (ie not too many high cardinality variables or mostly missing columns)
And then the neural network is applied to predict survival rates from the test data set. 


################### Mechanical fluid pump (data1.csv) ##################
Neural Network gives an example of using a neural network on a set of data monitoring faliure of mechanical parts as the target for a binary clsasifier.
